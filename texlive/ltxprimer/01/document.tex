\section{Dividing the document}
\subsection{Example}
In this example, we show how subsections and subsubsections are produced
(there are no subsubsubsections). Note how the subsections are numbered.
\subsubsection{Subexample}
Did you note that subsubsections are not numbered? This is so in the \texttt{book}
and \texttt{report} classes. In the \texttt{article} class they too have numbers.
(Can you figure out why?)
\paragraph{Note}
Paragraphs and subparagraphs do not have numbers. And they have \textit{run-in} headings.

Though named ''paragraph'' we can have several paragraphs of text within this.

\subparagraph{Subnote}
Subparagraphs have an additional indentation too.

And they can also contain more than one paragraph of text.
